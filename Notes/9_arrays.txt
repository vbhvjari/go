Arrays

-> collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory locations
-> fixed length -- once it is declared, its size cannot be changed
-> mutable - value can be changed later
-> length: no of elements in array
-> capacity: no of elements it can contain
-> length and capacity both same in Array


Why do we need arrays
-> need to store large amount of same type
-> instead of creating different variables with same type, can create one variable and store values together

Syntax:
var <array_name> <array_size><data_type>

-> Array elements are indexed and index starts with 0 and last element is length-1
   0 <= index <= length-1

Multidimensional array
-> e.g. 2D - two dimensional element
[x][y] --> x - size of array; y - size of elements in each
