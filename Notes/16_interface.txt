Interfaces

- specifies set of methods
- like blueprint for method sets
- allows modualar programming
- describe all methods of method set by providing functon signature for each method
- specify set of methods, but do not implement them

Syntax:
type <interface_name> interface {
    method1_name(parameter_list) (return_types)
    method2_name(parameter_list) (return_types)
    ...
}

Interface in Golang are implemented implicitly and it doesn't require any explicit declaration.


If you do these actions, I don't care what you are.
Example: USB port - It only cares - you can send/receive data ; doesn't care if you plug keyboard, mouse, pendrive

Inferface in Golang
- set of method signatures
- defines what type can do, not what it is
- is about behaviour, not structure

Declaration:
type <interface_name> interface {
    method-signatures
}

Example:
type Speaker interface {
    speak()
}
This means, any type that has speak() method, is a Speaker

Implementation:
- No explicit Implementation; it's implicit by Golang

- Internally, interface stores {type, value}


simple analogy terms:

Struct -> data
Method -> ability
Interface -> contract
