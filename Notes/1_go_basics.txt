Programming language - interact with computer


Go or Golang Language 

- created by Google
- Previously source code used to deployed using C/C++ -- complexity
- Go --> Ease of Programming , Interpreted language (e.g. Python)
- efficient, support - network and multiple computing

- compiled programming language

High level language - understood by humans - source code
Machine level language - understood by machine - machine code

Convert source code to machine code - using compiler or interpreter 

Compiler --> scan entire program and then translate whole source code into machine code
Interpreter --> translate source code into machine code line by line

-----------
Static/Strong typed language
- Compiler throws an error when types are used incorrectly 
- Type check occurs at compile time 
- e.g. C, C++, Java

Advantages:
- Better performance 
- Bugs can be caught by Compiler
- Better data integrity
-----

Dynamic/loosy types language 
- Compiler does not enforce the type system
- Type check occurs at runtime
- e.g. Python, Javascript, PHD

Advantages:
- Faster to write code
