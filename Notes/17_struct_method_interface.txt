Srtuct -> Method -> Interface

Struct - holds data - what information do I have
example - Student ID card - it holds information - name, roll no, grade

Method - actions related to data - what can I do 
example - speak english, write emails 

Interface - rule/expectation - what should be possible
example - must speak english, must write emails 
          (It doesn't care whether you are student/teacher; it only cares if you can speak engilish, can write emails)
