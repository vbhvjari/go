Constants

- variable whose value cannot be modified after intialised
Format:
const <constant_name> <datatype> = <value>

<datatype> --> optional

Untyped constant --> <datatype> not provided during initialisation 

Typed constant --> <datatype> provided during initialisation 


Examples:

Untyped:
-> const age = 29
-> const name, age = "Vaibhav", 29


Typed:
-> const age int = 12


Note:
-> Constant needs to be declared and initialised at the same time
-> shorthand operator not supported for constant
