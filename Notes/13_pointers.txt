Pointers

- Memory management - RAM 
- whenever any variable is declared, certain amount of memory is allocated to store that variable - size of memory depends on data type of variable
- Pointer 
    - variable that holds the memory address of another variable
    - points where memory is allocated and provides way to find or even change the value located at memory location.

- address operator - &
  address of variable can be obtained by preceding name of variable with &

- dereference operator - *
  When placed before an address, it returns the value stored at that address

Declare pointer
var <pointer_name> *<data_type> => data type of varaible whose address we want to save in another variable(which is pointer)
The * in pointer declaration is different from deference operator

zero value of pointer : nil

Initialise pointer

# With explicit data_type
var <pointer_name> *<data_type> = &<variable_name>

# Without data_type
var <pointer_name> = &<variable_name>

# Shorthand
<pointer_name> := &<variable_name>

Deference pointer  -> *<pointer_name>
