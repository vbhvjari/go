- user defined data type
- structure that groups together related data to form a single unit
- provides a way to reference series of grouped values through a single variable name
- used to group/associate two or more data types

declaration
type <struct_name> struct {

}

Initialization

Method-1:
var <variable_name> <struct_name>
- Creates instance of struct with zero values

Method-2:
<variable_name> := new(struct_name)

Method-3: Shorthand
<variable_name> := <struct_name>{
    <field1>: <value1>,
    <field2>: <value2>,
}

Access fields of Struct
<variable_name>.<field_name>

Comparing two instances of same struct
- structs of same type can be compared using equality operators (== or !=)
