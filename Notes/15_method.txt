Method

- A method augments a function by adding an extra parameter immediately after "func" keyword that accepts  a single argument
- This augment - receiver
- Method is a function with a special receiver argument

Syntax:
func (receiver_name receiver_type) method_name(parameters) (return_types) {
    // method body
}
- receiver_name - name of the variable that represents the instance of the type on which method is called
- receiver_type - type of the receiver (can be struct, int, float, etc)
- method_name - name of the method
- parameters - input parameters (optional)
- return_types - return types (optional)    


limitation of function
- two functions with same name cannot exist in same package

Method
- a function that is attached to a specific receiver(type) argument
- defines behaviour of type 
- should use state of the type
- output of method is dependant on the type of receiver
- different methods with same name(with different receiver) can exist
- Method belongs to type

To define a method on a type, the definition of the receiver type and the definition of the method should be present in the same package.
