Go 
- Compiled programming language (Scan entire program first and then translate whole source code into machine code)
- Static/Strong typed language (Type check occurs at compile time), Once type is assigned to variable, it cannot be changed during runtime
- Error Detection - Caught by Compiler during compile time
- Faster execution and better performance

Python
- Interpreted programming language (Translate source code into machine code line by line)
- Strong typed - Type check occurs at runtime - Cannot mix incompatible types. e.g. cannot add string and integer("2" + 3)
- Dynamic/loosy typed language - variable is allowed to change value during runtime
- Error Detection - Caught by Interpreter during runtime
- Slower execution compared to compiled languages
